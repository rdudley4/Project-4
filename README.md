Project #4 : Photo Gallery (WIP)

TODO
-----------------
1. Implement filtering.
2. Update page styling while still adhering to project specs.
3. Implement full-screen lightbox functionality.
4. (Maybe) Add lightbox circles per gallery-item for dots-like nav.
5. (Maybe) Add gallery-item hover effect, perhaps a semi-transparent div with some imagery and text?
