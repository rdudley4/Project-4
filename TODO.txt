 List of TODO's
----------------
1. Implement results notification system.
  	a. When user is filtering results, display how many reults are matched to the query.
  	b. If there are no results, display a message saying no results were found.
  	
2. Update Animations
	a. Switch the lightbox fade toggle from jQuery to velocity so we can take advantage of hw
	acceleration on mobile devices for better performance.
	b. Maybe update updateImage to use velocity.ui utility function as well.
	c. Clean up other non ui velocity animations code to single line.
